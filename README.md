Repository for INFO 7255 Course Project on REST API Development at Northeastern University - 2023

This repository encompasses the development of a prototype model for a REST API as part of the INFO 7255 course requirements.

Pre-requisites: For this particular segment of the course, I have focused on creating a backend REST API. The technology stack employed includes:

Spring Boot for the primary framework
Redis as the data storage solution, functioning as a key-value store
Implementation of Json Schema Validator for data validation

Key Features of the Prototype Demo 1:

Creation of a REST API using Spring Boot, designed to interpret and process a specified sample JSON schema.
Integration of Redis for storing the JSON schema, utilizing its key-value storage capabilities.
Implementation and demonstration of basic RESTful operations such as GET, POST, and DELETE in the initial prototype demonstration.
This project aims to showcase the fundamental aspects of REST API development using modern technology and tools, tailored to the course's learning objectives.
